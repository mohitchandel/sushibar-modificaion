# Sample Hardhat Project

Forked SushiSwapâ€™s SushiBar contract and modified it to implement following featuresStaking:
Time lock after staking:
- 2 days - 0% can be unstaked
- 2-4 days - 25% can be unstaked
- 4-6 days - 50% can be unstaked
- 6-8 days - 75% can be unstaked
- After 8 days - 100% can be unstaked.

This will work like a high tax though.
- 0-2 days - locked
- 2-4 days - 75% tax
- 4-6 days - 50% tax
- 6-8 days - 25% tax
- After 8 days, 0% tax.
The tokens received on tax will go back into rewards pool.
